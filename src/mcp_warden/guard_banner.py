"""Startup posture banner for ``guard`` (GUARD_PROXY_V3.md §4, §4.4).

A pure, deterministic renderer for the one-shot stderr banner that ``guard``
emits at startup (after the config is fully resolved, before the child's first
frame) so an operator can see — at a glance, before any traffic flows — exactly
which protections are ENFORCED, which are MONITOR-only, and which are INACTIVE
for this run.

Single source of truth (binding): the banner derives ENTIRELY from a resolved
:class:`~mcp_warden.guard_loop.GuardConfig`. It reads only the public posture
predicates that already encode v0.3 precedence (``audit_only`` > ``no_block_*`` >
default-block / ``block_inject_phrase``):

  * :meth:`GuardConfig.category_enabled` — per result-rule blocking.
  * :meth:`GuardConfig.list_changed_enabled` — ``tools/list_changed`` drift gate.
  * :meth:`GuardConfig.policy_block_enabled` — argument-policy deny.

and the ``armed_*`` / ``strict`` / ``strict_frame_cap`` fields. It NEVER takes the
server ``command``/``args`` — the banner is POSTURE, not server identity, so a
secret-bearing argv can never reach it (redaction invariant).

Deterministic-tier ground truth (RESULT_INSPECTION.md §2): the BLOCKING bucket is
DERIVED from ``result_inspection.BLOCK_RULES`` — the single source of truth for
which deterministic result rules block on the wire — so it tracks whatever the
catalog actually blocks, regardless of how many rules ship. The banner walks a
fixed, ordered label map (``_DET_TIERS``) and keeps only the ids that are both in
``BLOCK_RULES`` AND enabled by config; membership is therefore DYNAMIC (catalog-
driven) while order stays deterministic (map-driven, not frozenset iteration
order). Any ``BLOCK_RULES`` id missing from the map falls back to rendering its
rule id, so a blocking tier is never silently omitted. This reflects ACTUAL
runtime behavior, never aspirational copy.

The returned string is PLAIN TEXT (no ANSI/Rich markup): the CLI prints it via
``err_console.print(..., highlight=False)`` and tests assert on substrings, so it
must carry no embedded color codes — mirroring
:func:`mcp_warden.guard_lifecycle.platform_refusal_message`.

#: a superset that may name rules not yet present in ``BLOCK_RULES`` on a given

    """Render the startup posture banner from a resolved :class:`GuardConfig`.

    Pure, deterministic, no I/O. The banner is grouped into buckets so an operator
    can read the run's enforcement posture before any traffic flows:

      * **BLOCKING (active)** — tiers that block on the wire this run. Under
        ``--audit-only`` this collapses to a single "ALL BLOCKING DISABLED" line
        (nothing is enforced; everything is detect-and-log).
      * **MONITOR-ONLY** — tiers that detect + log but never block: the fuzzy
        ``WRD-RES-INJECT-PHRASE`` tier when ``--block-inject-phrase`` is NOT set,
        plus the §4.4 note that frames with no correlated request id (and
        uninspectable/non-``tools/call`` frames) pass through uninspected.
      * **INACTIVE** — protections that are not armed for this run: the
        ``tools/list_changed`` drift gate without ``--lock`` and the argument
        policy without ``--policy``.
      * **fail-open / strictness** — whether an internal inspection error fails
        OPEN (default) or fails CLOSED (``--strict``), and whether an over-cap
        frame passes through (default) or terminates the session
        (``--strict-frame-cap``).

    Single source of truth: every line is derived from ``cfg``'s public posture
    predicates (``category_enabled`` / ``list_changed_enabled`` /
    ``policy_block_enabled``) and the ``armed_*`` / ``strict`` / ``strict_frame_cap``
    fields. The banner names NO server (no ``command``/``args``), so no argv or
    secret can leak through it.

    Args:
        cfg: The fully-resolved guard configuration (post opt-out / ``--audit-only``
            / arming resolution, exactly as built in ``cli_guard.guard``).

    Returns:
        A multi-line, plain-text banner (no trailing newline, no ANSI/Rich markup).
