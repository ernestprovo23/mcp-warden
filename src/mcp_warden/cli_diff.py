"""CLI command body for ``warden diff`` — offline, redacted lock comparison (#20).

Split from ``cli.py`` to keep each module under the LOC budget. ``register(app,
console, err_console)`` attaches the ``diff`` command (matching the
``cli_lock.py`` idiom).

``diff`` is a **renderer over the existing drift engine** (``compute_drift``),
NOT a second ``check``: it compares two EXISTING lock files offline (no capture),
renders integrity drift grouped by severity, and surfaces #19 provenance changes
in a separate, clearly-labeled informational section. It adds NO diff logic and
changes NO contract.

Redaction contract (the security surface): the renderer consumes ONLY
:class:`~mcp_warden.drift.DriftItem` objects (safe by construction — server
identity drift is a hardcoded "launch changed" message, schema ``detail`` is
pre-redacted) plus an explicit allowlist of SAFE provenance fields
(:data:`SAFE_PROVENANCE_FIELDS`). It NEVER reads ``lock.server.command`` or
``lock.server.args`` for display (only ``command_digest``), so a secret embedded
in launch argv can never leak into any output mode.
