"""Shared check core: the single source of truth for the ``check`` verdict.

Both ``cli.py:check`` and the pre-commit wrapper (``precommit.py``) call
:func:`run_check` so a local hook and CI can never disagree on a drift verdict
(issue: "a hook that disagrees with CI is worse than no hook").

The sequence here mirrors what ``check`` has always done:
``read_lock`` -> ``capture_surface_sync`` -> ``run_checks`` -> ``build_lock``
(an in-memory CURRENT lock, never persisted) -> ``compute_drift``.

# INTERNAL STABILITY NOTE: the pre-commit wrapper (precommit.py) depends on this
# function's signature and exception contract (CaptureError for spawn/timeout
# failures; FileNotFoundError / ValueError for a missing/invalid lock). Do not
# change either without updating precommit.py.
#
# DETERMINISM: this shared verdict path MUST stay free of environment-dependent
# behavior (cwd-, time-, locale-, or env-var-conditioned branches). The local
# pre-commit hook and CI both reach the drift verdict through this exact code, so
# any non-deterministic branch here would let a local hook verdict diverge from
# CI — the precise failure ("a hook that disagrees with CI") this module exists
# to prevent.
