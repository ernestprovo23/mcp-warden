"""CLI helpers for #16 Sigstore signing/verification (``pin --sign`` / ``check --verify``).

Split from ``cli.py`` to keep that module under the LOC budget. These helpers are
invoked by the ``pin`` and ``check`` command bodies and own ALL signing/verify
control flow, including the fail-closed exit semantics.

Fail-closed contract (this is a security gate):

  * Missing optional extra -> exit non-zero with an install message.
  * Signing error -> exit non-zero, NO half-written sidecar (we write the bundle
    to a temp file and atomically replace; on any error the original sidecar — if
    any — is untouched and no partial file remains).
  * Verify: the bundle is loaded from a FIXED path (``<lockdir>/warden.lock.sigstore``
    or an explicit ``--offline-bundle``); the attacker-controlled pointer field in
    the lock is NEVER read for pathing. The statement is RECOMPUTED from the lock's
    own ``overall_digest``. ANY exception from verify -> exit 1. Success (no
    exception) -> print OK + exit 0.
