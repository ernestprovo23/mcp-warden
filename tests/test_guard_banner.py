"""Startup posture-banner renderer + ``--quiet`` wiring (GUARD_PROXY_V3.md §4).

The banner is a one-shot stderr surface emitted at ``guard`` startup (after the
config resolves, before the child's first frame) so an operator sees the run's
ENFORCED / MONITOR-only / INACTIVE posture before any traffic flows. This module
proves, at two levels:

  * Renderer level (``render_posture_banner``): a PURE function of the resolved
    :class:`~mcp_warden.guard_loop.GuardConfig`. Each test toggles ONE posture
    field and asserts the banner moves the corresponding tier between buckets —
    so a no-op renderer that always lists every tier (or never drops one) FAILS.
  * CLI level: drive the registered ``guard`` command with the SAME harness
    ``test_guard_platform.py`` uses (a ``run_guard`` spy so no child spawns), and
    assert ``--quiet`` suppresses the banner while the default emits it, and that
    a ``--no-block-*`` opt-out flows all the way through cfg -> banner -> stderr.

Ground-truth note (derivation, not enumeration): the banner's BLOCKING bucket is
DERIVED from ``result_inspection.BLOCK_RULES`` — the catalog's single source of
truth for which deterministic result rules block — so it tracks whatever the
catalog actually blocks at any merge order.
``test_banner_blocking_set_equals_enabled_block_rules`` asserts the rendered
blocking-rule set EQUALS the ``BLOCK_RULES`` members enabled under the given
config (so it never fabricates a tier that is NOT in ``BLOCK_RULES``, and never
omits one that is), and ``test_banner_blocking_is_live_to_block_rules`` proves the
derivation is live by extending ``BLOCK_RULES`` with a synthetic rule and showing
the banner picks it up (a hardcoded renderer would fail this).

Redaction invariant: the banner takes ONLY ``cfg`` (never ``command``/``args``),
so a secret-bearing server argv can never reach it.
