# Pinned example: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`

Knowledge-graph memory MCP server from the Model Context Protocol project. Its
surface is a fixed set of graph-editing tools with static input schemas — no
machine-local defaults — so the committed lock verifies identically on every
machine and in CI.

- Package: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`
- Launcher: `npx` with the version pinned to `@2026.1.26`
- Surface in this lock: **9 tools, 0 resources, 0 prompts**

The version is pinned in the launch argv (`@2026.1.26`) so `WRD-SUP-NPX-UNPINNED`
does not fire — the server resolves to a fixed release, not whatever `latest`
points to at run time.

## Pin (how `warden.lock` was generated)

```bash
mcp-warden pin \
  --approve --approver "examples@mcp-warden.invalid" \
  --lock warden.lock \
  -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@2026.1.26
```

The `--` separator ends mcp-warden's own options; everything after it is the
server launch argv. `-y` tells `npx` to auto-install the pinned version without
an interactive prompt.

## Check (what CI re-runs against the committed lock)

```bash
mcp-warden check \
  --lock warden.lock \
  -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@2026.1.26
```

Exit 0 = surface matches the lock. Exit 1 = drift. Exit 2 = capture error.

## Notes

- One static finding is baked into the lock: `WRD-CAP-SQL` on the `search_nodes`
  tool (its `query` property trips the capability heuristic). This is a
  capability annotation, not drift — `check` reproduces it identically.
- Every tool's `inputSchema` is fixed at the package level, so the surface
  digest does not depend on the host environment (timezone, locale, etc.).
- `command_digest` hashes the literal launch argv (`npx … @2026.1.26`), not the
  resolved binary, so this lock verifies identically on any machine.
